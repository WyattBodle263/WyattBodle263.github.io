        Hi there! My name is Wyatt Bodle and I grew up in Victorville, California as a triplet with an older sister.
        I was always a curious kid, constantly seeking to understand how things worked. From a young age, I would help
        my dad work on the car and explore the way things functioned.
        <br>
        <br>
        As I grew up, I discovered my passion for sports and took a special liking to soccer at the age of four.
        I played club and high school soccer up until the end of my senior year. But in addition to my love for sports,
        I also found myself fascinated with technology and software development.</br>
        <br>
        During the Covid-19 pandemic, I spent a lot of time researching Swift iOS development and began teaching myself
        with the help of YouTube tutorials and documentation. This experience sparked my interest in pursuing computer
        science and engineering in college.

        After moving to Dana Point during my junior year of high school, I began researching colleges and ultimately decided to attend California Baptist University (CBU) because of its smaller class sizes and personalized approach to education.
        <br>
        <br>
        Once at CBU, I found myself quickly adjusting to campus life and building connections with my fellow engineering students. In my sophomore year, I began seeking out extracurricular activities and joined both the newly founded competitive robotics team and the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) team.
        </br>
        <br>
        I am passionate about learning new things and exploring new ways of solving problems. I take great pleasure in finding creative solutions and algorithms to problems that others have not yet thought of. I'm excited to continue my education and see where my passion for technology and engineering will take me in the future.
