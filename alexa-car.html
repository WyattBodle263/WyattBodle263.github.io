                        <p> During our EGR101 project, my group successfully built an Alexa-controlled car using an Arduino Uno, an ESP to facilitate the Wi-Fi connection, and a motor controller. The car was able to move forward, backward, left, and right, all controlled by voice commands given through an Alexa device. We encountered several challenges during the project, such as ensuring stable Wi-Fi connectivity and learning the Arduino programming language as well as UI, but ultimately overcame them through teamwork and perseverance. Our hard work paid off when we were selected to present our project at the Engineering Showcase hosted by the College of Engineering. Overall, this project was a great learning experience and allowed us to apply our knowledge in a practical and innovative way. </p>
