        Swish Stats is the must-have app for basketball players who want to track their performance and compare it with their opponent. Whether you're playing around the world, free throws, or 1v1 basketball competitions, Swish Stats has got you covered. With this app, you can easily track your scores, 3 pointers, free throws, and more, and see how you stack up against your opponent. The app provides an easy way to see who's in the lead and who needs to step up their game. Swish Stats also lets you save your game history, so you can see how you've progressed over time.</p>
       <p> I designed this app for a friend of mine, Erik.  During my freshman year of College almost every night, me and Erik would go out to the basketball courts and play a game.  We would challenge each-other to Around the world, which we called “The Game”, free throws, or 1 v 1s.  We kept our stats and scores in my notes app until I decided to develop this app to keep track of our scores and save our scores in a very easy to use manner without using much brain power.</p>
