    <p>Introducing "LoveNotes", the ultimate app designed for couples to stay connected and plan date night ideas with ease. With its user-friendly interface, couples can send messages and make plans, ensuring that they are always on the same page. Plus, with the app's built-in timer, couples can keep track of their relationship milestones down to the seconds, making it easy to celebrate every moment of their journey together. </p>
    <p>      I designed this app originally as a way for me and my girlfriend to be able to have personalized messages we could send to each other as well as remembering date nights.  We would always say how fun something sounded to do for a date night but when date night came around we would never remember all the good ideas we had.  It was designed in swift using X-Code.  It is also not yet published, I am still working on finishing touches before I decided to publish it to the app store.</p>
