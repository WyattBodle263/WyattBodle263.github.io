<p>PK Shootout is a enjoyable app that puts your penalty kick skills to the test against a virtual goalkeeper. Swipe to shoot the ball and see if you can score past the keeper who dives or stays in the middle. Swipe one of three ways to choose your direction and the faster you swipe the harder your kick. The app brings the game to life and creates an immersive soccer atmosphere. Whether you're a die-hard soccer fan or just looking for a fun way to pass the time, PK Shootout is the perfect app for you</p>
<p>This was my first app I ever developed and published in swift.  It was a real challenge and was the foundation . of learning random numbers, loops, and basic algorithms.  I also designed and drew all of the characters, the ball and the goals.  It also features a leaderboard that goes through Game Center.  This app was also available on the app store for years until I discontinued my subscription with Apple Developer</p>
