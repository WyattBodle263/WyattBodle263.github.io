        Joining any new club, especially a competition club can be a daunting challenge, especially when it comes to team organization, scheduling meetings and ultimately getting the footing needed to make a competition robot within a small time frame.   That was the problem we faced in October 2022.  We found a small space previously used to store tools and over the course of two weeks converted it into a robotics lab with the necessary tools and resources needed.  We then got as many parts as we could with a tight budget and limited resources and began to build our robots.

             Our president then began to structure the team into four groups, programming, build, manufacturing, and marketing.  Once we had our team it was time to begin.  Our main objective was to pick up discs and score in a basket on the other side of the field against other Vex College teams.  This required hours of work in the lab to develop the code to output diagnostics to our display, create the drive train, come up with and program our algorithms for maneuvering and firing the discs. I collaborated with a team of eight programmers and our three other divisions to develop accurate and reliable code.

    <p>     During the competition, I also assisted the mechanical team with repairs and implementing new parts to solve problems. With only 30 minutes between each run, it was crucial to work efficiently and effectively to make any necessary adjustments to the robot. Through these experiences, I gained a deeper understanding of the mechanical aspects of robotics and the importance of collaboration between the computer and mechanical teams.</p>
    <p>     Our first competition was held in February 2023, and despite being the youngest club there, we were able to hold our own against more experienced teams. We competed in 10 matches and won the majority of them, winning 6 out of 10 matches. While we ultimately lost in the quarterfinals, we were proud of our accomplishments and the progress we had made as a team.    </p>
    <p>     Overall, my experience in the robotics club was both challenging and rewarding. Through my hard work and dedication, I was able to make valuable contributions to the team's success and gain valuable skills in both the mechanical and computer sides of robotics. I am grateful for the opportunity to have been a part of such a passionate and driven team, and I look forward to continuing to develop my skills in this field.</p>

        <p> During our EGR101 project, my group successfully built an Alexa-controlled car using an Arduino Uno, an ESP to facilitate the Wi-Fi connection, and a motor controller. The car was able to move forward, backward, left, and right, all controlled by voice commands given through an Alexa device. We encountered several challenges during the project, such as ensuring stable Wi-Fi connectivity and learning the Arduino programming language as well as UI, but ultimately overcame them through teamwork and perseverance. Our hard work paid off when we were selected to present our project at the Engineering Showcase hosted by the College of Engineering. Overall, this project was a great learning experience and allowed us to apply our knowledge in a practical and innovative way. </p>
